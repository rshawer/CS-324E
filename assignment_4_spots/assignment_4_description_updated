Assignment 4

In this assignment, 3 types of objects were created and used to animate a scene in Processing. 
A person class was created, which was implemented in three different instances to create a crowd of people watching the scene play out 
while cheering. The movement of the person's arms is dependant upon whether the entire object is moving up or down. A transitioning 
background was also created, switching betweend day and night continuously. Bouncing star-balls were created as well. 
The spherical star object has two levels to it. The circle can be comapared as the body while the spikes are the ray of light that 
forms a star. The circle translates around the map and moves around. The star/spears will rotate as the entire body moves.

Jason Lan/Changjie Lan: Was responsible for the stars/ball class (the spiked object class). Implemented motions and the rotations of 
the stars/spikes of the object.
Waleed Khan: Created the crowd of humans jumping up and down with moving arms. Also did the base functionality for the stars/ball classes, 
which bounced around the screen.
